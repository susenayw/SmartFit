## 📊 Datasets

This project is powered by three curated datasets:

### 1. `master_smartfit_final.csv` — Activity & BMI Tracking
Schema for physical metrics and daily activity logs. Key columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `bmi` | Body Mass Index |
| `TotalSteps` | Daily step count |
| `VeryActiveMinutes` | Minutes of high-intensity activity |
| `SedentaryMinutes` | Minutes of inactivity |
| `Calories` | Total calories burned |
| `Recommendation_Label` | Activity-based recommendation category |

### 2. `abbrev_cleaned.csv` — Nutrition Database
A comprehensive food nutrition reference with **8,618 food items** (zero null values).

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total food entries | 8,618 |
| Calorie range | 0 – 902 kcal |
| Average calories | 226.4 kcal |
| Average protein | 11.5 g |
| Average carbohydrates | 21.8 g |
| Foods under 250 kcal | 5,345 items (62%) |

Columns: `food_name`, `calories`, `protein`, `fat`, `carbs`, `fiber`, `sugar`

### 3. `food_choices_cleaned.csv` — Community Lifestyle Preferences
Survey data from **120 respondents** capturing real eating and exercise habits.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total respondents | 120 |
| Top cuisine | Italian (47 respondents, ~39%) |
| Other popular cuisines | Mexican, American, Chinese, Asian |
| Rarely exercise (level 1) | 57 respondents (47.5%) |
| Sometimes exercise (level 2) | 41 respondents (34.2%) |
| Often exercise (level 3) | 10 respondents (8.3%) |

Columns: `Gender`, `fav_cuisine`, `eating_out`, `exercise`, `weight`, `GPA`

## 🔍 EDA Insights

Key findings from the Exploratory Data Analysis phase:

**Nutrition Distribution**
- The nutrition database has a median of 191 kcal per food item, with 62% of foods falling under the 250 kcal threshold used for the low-calorie filter.
- Protein content ranges widely (0–88g), enabling effective high-protein food filtering for underweight profiles.

**Community Lifestyle Patterns**
- Italian cuisine dominates preferences at ~39% of respondents — significantly ahead of Mexican (8%) and American (6%), informing the cuisine-based personalization logic.
- Nearly half (47.5%) of respondents exercise rarely, highlighting the importance of activity-nudge recommendations in the app.
- Eating out frequency peaks at level 2 (moderate), suggesting most users balance home and restaurant meals.

**BMI Re-calibration Logic**
- For *Overweight/Obese* profiles: `kg_to_lose = weight - (24.9 × height_m²)`
- For *Underweight* profiles: `kg_to_gain = (18.5 × height_m²) - weight`

## 🧠 How the Recommendation Logic Works

```
User Input (gender, weight, height)
        ↓
   Calculate BMI
        ↓
   ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  BMI < 18.5  → Underweight        │
   │  18.5–24.9   → Normal             │
   │  BMI ≥ 25    → Overweight/Obese   │
   └────────────────────────────────────┘
        ↓
   Re-calibration target (kg difference)
        ↓
   Food filter from abbrev_cleaned.csv:
   • Overweight → foods < 250 kcal only
   • Normal/Underweight → diverse random sample
        ↓
   Cuisine tag from food_choices_cleaned.csv
   (random community preference sample)
```
